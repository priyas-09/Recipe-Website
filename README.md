Ojha Recipes - Flask Web App

This is a recipe search web application built with **Flask** that uses the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) to let users search for recipes by name.

You can enter a recipe name (like "Pasta" or "Chicken") and get details including the image, category, region, and a link to instructions.
